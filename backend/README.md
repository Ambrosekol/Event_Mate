Project Description

This project is a simple backend server for a web application. It is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The backend server handles all the API requests and communicates with a SQL database to perform CRUD operations.

Project Organization

The backend directory is organized as follows:

config.py: configuration file for the Flask app
models.py: contains the SQLAlchemy models for the database
routes.py: contains the Flask routes and API endpoints
util.py: contains utility functions used throughout the app
requirements.txt: list of required packages to run the app
.env: environment variables used for the app

First-time Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

Create a virtual environment using virtualenv and activate it.
Install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
Set environment variables in a .env file or via command line:

  DB_USER=your_db_username
  DB_PASS=your_db_password
  DB_NAME=your_db_name
  DB_HOST=your_db_host
  SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

Initialize the database using 'flask db init'
Run database migrations using 'flask db migrate'
Populate the database with sample data using 'flask db upgrade'
Run the app locally using 'flask run'

Testing

To test the API endpoints, use curl or postman to make requests to the following endpoints:

GET /users: returns all the users
GET /users/<user_id>: returns a specific user
POST /users: creates a new user
PUT /users/<user_id>: updates a specific user
DELETE /users/<user_id>: deletes a specific user

Debugging and Troubleshooting

To debug the app, you can use the built-in Flask debugger. To enable it, set the DEBUG environment variable to True in the .env file.

If you encounter any issues, check the following:

Ensure that all the dependencies are installed correctly.
Check the error logs in the terminal for any errors.
Check the .env file for any incorrect environment variables.
Check the database connection settings in the config.py file.
